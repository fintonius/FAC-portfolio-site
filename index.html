                    I am an intermediate Web Developer with a keen interest in animation. I love bringing the web to life through motion.

                    I come from an arts background with an MFA and BA in media art. I am very experienced working creatively with
                    limited resources to solve problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have many years experience working as a care worker for people with physical and mental disabilities. This has
                    instilled in me a strong desire to help others, work with empathy ... and a near bottomless well of patience!
